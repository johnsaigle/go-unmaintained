# TODO

## True positive (unmaintained) should be clearly separated in output from status unknown or trusted packages

right now they are all grouped together

## Add support for async requests

This would allow faster analysis of packages

Do so in a way that still respects existing caching/batching approaches in order to optimize around rate limiting
